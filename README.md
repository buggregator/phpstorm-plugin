The plugin integrates Buggregator into the JetBrains IDEs, allowing you to debug your code with ease.  
Now you don't need to switch to another window or screen to look at dumps and then back to run tests.
Everything is in front of you, and all the shortcuts work.

## Overview

Currently, the plugin only works for launching [Buggregator Trap](https://github.com/buggregator/trap) from the vendor directory (or any other), but we are working on making it compatible with the [Buggregator server application](https://github.com/buggregator/server) as well.
